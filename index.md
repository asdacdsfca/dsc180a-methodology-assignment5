**Name:** Andrew Zhao

**Email:** yiz158@ucsd.edu

**Section:** B09  
**Mentor:** Hungjen Wang, Rinnie Han  

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
<br>
Market sentiment indicators is the most compelling topic. It can capture the emotions and psychology driving market behavior, offering insights that traditional analyses may miss. These indicators help predict price movements influenced by optimism or fear, often ahead of fundamentals.


**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
<br>
We propose to experiment methods for identifying alpha in financial data. Our objective is to develop strategies that combine existing analytical tools to uncover predictive signals within extensive datasets. By integrating various perspectives and methodologies, we aim to enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts and contribute to more informed decision-making in the financial sector.

**What is a potential change you would make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** 
<br>
A potential change we would make to the approach taken in our current Quarter 1 Project is placing greater emphasis on critically analyzing and refining the tools we use for data analysis. In Quarter 1, our focus was largely on applying existing tools to financial datasets without fully exploring their limitations, assumptions, or how they might interact when combined.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
<br>
I am interested interested in using AI tools like LSTMs and Transformers for analyzing time-series data and NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured data, such as news and social media sentiment.
